/// able to treat each view as a function of its `initialConfiguration` and its `viewModel`, making the declarative API much
/// easier to reason about.

  /// that do not change based on the data in the `viewModel`.

  /// view.

  /// Creates a view using an initial configuration that contains all of the immutable / initial setup data necessary to configure the
  /// view. All immutable / view-model-independent properties should be configured here. For example, you might set up a
  /// `UILabel`'s `textAlignment`, `textColor`, and `font`, assuming none of those things change in response to
  /// `viewModel` updates.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - initialConfiguration: An instance containing all of the immutable / initial setup data necessary to initialize the view.
  ///   Use this to configure appearance options that do not change based on the data in the `viewModel`.
